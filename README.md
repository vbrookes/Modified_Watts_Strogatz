# Modified_Watts_Strogatz

# This is a Python 3.5 implementation of the Watts-Strogatz algorithm to generate small-world networks with an empirical degree and edge-weight distribution. Construction of this code was motivated by fieldwork in northern Australia in which networks of free-roaming dogs were observed to have small-world properties (low average shortest path length and high global clustering coefficient). Larger networks were generated using this code to test disease transmission patterns.
